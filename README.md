## How to create your own website using Hugo & Github Pages?

Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. 

Hugo provides us a wide variety of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) which makes it easier to create & maintain simple websites. The theme used in this repository is called [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/).

### 1) Create a new repository

### 2) Create a new site using Hugo

### 3) Configure Github Actions to Publish to the Github Pages

Github automatically deploys the code at https://<username>.github.io.
To deploy your website under a custom Domain Name refer to [this](https://theplaybook.dev/docs/deploy-hugo-to-github-pages/) article.
