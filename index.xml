      <description>I am writing this guide to save my progress and let others contribute to increasing linux performance even further; after all, many are better than one. You can use all of them or just a few of them. Read a topic fully before starting.

NOTE: This guide is not for beginners who are new to Linux but a few of them can be used safely by them.</description>
